This is to visualize the genotypic alterations or mutational landscape from 18 samples of pateints with a rare type of kidney cancer called translocation Renal Cell Carcinoma (tRCC). These visualizes the no. of SNVs, INDELs and other alterations after variant calls and filtering from GATK mutect2 pipelines. All the data used in this analyses are found in ... 
Background of the data - These are whole genome sequencing data from a cohort of tumor-normal pairs from patients with TFE3-TRCC to characterize at DFCI, This study is to test the hypothesis that there are specific mutations or alterations on the DNA that could be specific to TFE3-translocation RCC.
